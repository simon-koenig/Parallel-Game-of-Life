# Parallel-Game-of-Life
Game of Life to explore parallel sped up. University project to explore strong/weak scaling using MPI

The Game of Life is a simple time-stepping Matrix algorithm. The cells in a $ n_r x n_c $ size matrix are updated according to a condition concerning the cell itself an its neighbours.
The aim of this project is to implement a sequential and multiple parallel algorithms playing the game of life.
